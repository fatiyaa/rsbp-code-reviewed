## go-gin-clean-starter.git\command\command.go

1. **Syntax and logical errors**:
   - The `Commands` function signature does not follow idiomatic Go practice. Functions that return a boolean indicating success or failure typically use an error as the second return value for clarity (e.g., `func Commands(db *gorm.DB) (bool, error)`). This allows callers to handle both the result and potential errors consistently.
   - There is no check for conflicting flags (e.g., if `--migrate` and `--seed` are used together, it's unclear what behavior should occur). It might be better to exit with an error message in this case instead of silently ignoring one flag when another is present.

2. **Code refactoring and quality**:
   - Consider using a struct to hold command-line arguments rather than individual boolean variables, which would make the code more maintainable and scalable if new commands are added in the future (e.g., `type CommandLineArgs struct { Migrate bool; Seed bool; Run bool; ScriptName string }`).
   - Refactor repetitive logging statements into separate functions or use Gin's context logger for consistency across different parts of the application that may also use Gin framework features like routing or middleware later on: https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin#contextual-logging .
    ```go
    func logMigrationSuccess() { logCtx("migration completed successfully") } // Helper function where logCtx handles actual logging logic including prefixes etc.. 		```logCmd := "migration" // Common prefix shared by multiple logs 	} else if cmd == scriptCmdPrefix+scriptName { 		logScriptRunSuccess() 	} else if runFlag && !errOccurred { 		logCmd = "run" // Use common helper functions here too... „ÄÄ``` )}. OnError(err, fmtLogPrefix+"error "+cmd+":", true) }) ```</code></pre>     </li>     <li>Extract each database operation into its own function with proper naming conventions such as 'performDatabaseMigration', 'populateDatabaseWithSeeds', 'executeCustomScript'.

## go-gin-clean-starter.git\config\database.go

****Syntax and Logical Errors:***
- The `panic(err)` in both `SetUpDatabaseConnection` and `CloseDatabaseConnection` will terminate the program if an error occurs. It's better to handle errors gracefully rather than panicking, especially in production environments.
- There is no need to panic on missing environment files or incorrect application mode; these should be handled with a clear error message and possibly logging, without crashing the application.

***Code Refactoring and Quality:***
- Consider using a struct to encapsulate database configuration details such as user, password, host, etc., which can then be passed as an argument to the database connection function for better maintainability and testability. This also allows you to avoid hardcoding sensitive information within your codebase.
- Instead of directly formatting the DSN string inside the function, consider creating a separate method that returns this string based on retrieved environment variables (this helps keep your code DRY).
- Use named return values for errors instead of returning plain `error`. This makes it easier to understand what went wrong when handling errors at call sites (e.g., use `db *gorm.DB, err error = SetUpDatabaseConnection()`).

***Performance Optimization:*** ÔøΩÔøΩouser1024***- Ensure that connections are closed properly by deferring `dbSQL.Close()` after starting a transaction or query execution where appropriate (not necessarily in every close method call). This ensures resources are released even if an error occurs later in processing logic wrapped by defer statements. For example: ```go dbSQL := db.(database/sql."Conn") // Assuming gorm provides access to underlying DB instance defer dbSQL.Close() endOfFunctionBody()```. Note: As per GORM documentation v2+ , there is no direct way to get underlying DB object due changes made internally so alternative approaches might be needed depending on GORM version used.)</li>**Security Vulnerabilities:*** ÔøΩÔøΩouser1025***- Avoid loading all environment variables from .env file into memory when running in production since some secrets could potentially leak through logs or core dumps.</li> <li>When deploying applications behind load balancers or reverse proxies like Nginx/HAProxy make sure they do not expose sensitive headers like X-Forwarded*. These can sometimes contain credentials meant only

## go-gin-clean-starter.git\config\email.go

****Syntax and Logical Errors:***

- Ensure that the `viper.SetConfigType("env")` is called before `ReadInConfig()` to explicitly set the configuration type to environment variables. This line might be missing, which could lead to Viper trying to read from all configured sources instead of just .env files.
- Check for proper error handling when reading environment variables in production environments, as setting them can expose sensitive information through logging or debugging tools. It's better to use a secure way of injecting secrets at runtime (e.g., HashiCorp Vault).
- Confirm that the `SMTP_*` prefixes used in the struct tags match exactly with those defined in the `.env` file; any discrepancy will result in unmarshalling errors.

***Code Refactoring and Quality:***

- Consider using a package like `os/environ` along with a helper function to parse environment variables into your config structure, reducing dependency on external packages like Viper for this specific task if it fits within your application's scope and complexity requirements.
- Extract common initialization code such as loading configurations into separate functions or an initializer function (e.g., InitEmailConfig) for better modularity and testability of each component separately from its setup logic. This also helps maintainability by isolating changes related specifically to configuration management away from business logic components where they are consumed by other parts of your system without needing knowledge about how they were initialized internally under different conditions etc.. üîÑ‚û°Ô∏è [Refactor] Initialization Code Into Separate Functions / An Initializer Function For Better Modularity And Testability - Example: Create an init function specifically for email config initialization that encapsulates all steps needed during startup phase(s), including parsing env vars & validating required fields exist before returning new instance ready for use elsewhere within app ecosystem... ‚úÖ Improved Readability By Encapsulating Configuration Loading Steps In A Dedicated Function Or Method - Example: Use Factory Pattern To Abstract The Creation Of Config Objects From Their Construction Logic... üöÄ Enhanced Maintainability By Isolating Changes Related Specifically To Configuration Management Away From Business Logic Components - Example: Move Common Setup Code Into Its Own Module With Clear Interfaces So That Other Parts Of Your System Can Depend On These Without Needing Internal Knowledge

## go-gin-clean-starter.git\constants\common.go

### Syntax and Logical Errors
- The `const` declarations in Go do not require the `ENUM_` prefix or the quotation marks around string literals. Here's a corrected version:
  ```go
  package constants

  const (
      ROLE_ADMIN = "admin"
      ROLE_USER = "user"
       // ... other constants without ENUM_, quotes, or unnecessary underscores
  )
  ```
- Although not an error per se, it's worth noting that using all uppercase for constant names is a convention in Go to distinguish them from variable names. The provided example already follows this convention. However, avoid starting constant names with 'ENUM_', as it implies they are enumerated types but does not serve any functional purpose in Go. It would be better to use descriptive names directly without the ENUM prefix. For example: `AdminRole`, `UserRole`. This improves readability and adheres to idiomatic Go practices.

## go-gin-clean-starter.git\controller\user_controller.go

1. **Syntax and logical errors**:
   - The `Register` method has a redundant check for an error that is already checked before returning. The second `if err != nil` can be removed without loss of functionality because if the service call fails, control will have already reached the return statement in the previous `if`.
   ```go
   func (c *userController) Register(ctx *gin.Context) {
       // ... existing code up to err assignment
       if err != nil {
           res := utils.BuildResponseFailed(dto.MESSAGE_FAILED_REGISTER_USER, err.Error(), nil)
          ctx.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, res) // This line handles the error case; no need for another check below
           return                            // Also, this 'return' might not be necessary as 'ctx.JSON' exits the function after flushing its writer buffer due to Abort() being called internally by JSON(). Otherwise, consider using 'ctx.Abort()' directly instead of wrapping it with 'ctx.JSON'.

Alternatively, you could refactor to eliminate unnecessary conditional checks altogether by handling all cases within your response builder methods like so: ```go+patch diff --git a/.buckconfig b/.buckconfig deleted file mode 100644 index ee10..index f DIFF = file ee10 deletion --- a/.buckconfig +++ /dev/null @@ -1 +0,0 @@ -build_style = simple # Remove this line when migrating from Buck v1 or legacy BUCK configs diff --git a/.eslintrc b/.eslintrc deleted

## go-gin-clean-starter.git\dto\pagination.go

### Syntax and Logical Errors
- The `PaginationResponse` struct has fields `Page`, `PerPage`, and `MaxPage`. However, the field names should be consistent. Typically, you would either use both as properties (e.g., `page` and `per_page`) or getters/setters (e.g., `GetPage()` and `SetPerPage(...)`). It's inconsistent to have one as a property and another as a method. Consider renaming the methods to match the property naming conventions or vice versa for consistency.
  - Rename either the field or the method to match each other (either all use camelCase or all use snake_case).
- The comment in Go is formed by two forward slashes (//), but it seems like there might be an intention to write a block comment that spans multiple lines; this could be misinterpreted if not properly formatted with slashes (*) on each line after the initial //.
  - Use multi-line comments correctly: ```go
    /* This is a multiline comment */
    ``` Or simply: ```go
    // A single line comment spread over multiple lines for clarity, avoid using /* ... */ unless necessary for longer descriptions.
    ```
- There is no logical error per se, but when dealing with pagination responses, it's common practice to include information about whether there are more items available beyond the current page max count‚Äîthis can help clients know if they should request additional pages even if 'MaxPage' indicates no further pages exist based on current filters/searches/sortings etc.). You may want to consider adding such metadata in your response structure if applicable. For example: ``NextAvailable`` boolean indicating presence of next page of results under certain conditions."* NextAvailable bool `json:"next_available"` * Ensure that when implementing logic around this new field, you account for edge cases where "no more data" does not necessarily mean "all data retrieved". **Code Refactoring and Quality**   - Extracting common functionality between different types into shared utility functions can improve code maintainability.* Create a separate package named utils containing helper functions like offset calculation which can then be used across different parts of your application.* Instead of having standalone methods within struct types for simple calculations like getting limit or offset from PaginationRequest/Response objects, consider defining these operations directly on those

## go-gin-clean-starter.git\dto\user_dto.go

1. **Syntax and Logical Errors**:
   - The constants and variables are defined with backticks instead of quotes for string literals (e.g., `MESSAGE_FAILED_GET_DATA_FROM_BODY`). In Go, strings should be enclosed in double quotes: `"failed get data from body"`.
   - The error messages are duplicated across both constants and variables, which is redundant. You can remove one of them to avoid confusion and potential inconsistencies.
   - There's no need to import the `mime/multipart` package if you're not using it within this file or any function called directly within this file unless it's imported at a higher level (like the main package). If it's not used, remove the import statement.

2. **Code Refactoring and Quality**:
   - Consider grouping related errors into custom error types rather than individual global variables (e.g., create an `ErrorUser` type that contains fields like `Create`, `GetAll`, etc.). This improves maintainability and makes error handling more consistent throughout your application.
   - Use snake case for variable names consistently (e.g., change `EmailOrPassword` to `email_or_password`) as it follows Google‚Äôs Go style guide recommendations more closely than camelCase does. Also, ensure all JSON tags use lowercase as well since they conflict with camelCase variable names when marshaling/unmarshalling JSON structures in most cases except for nested struct pointers where CamelCase might be acceptable but still debatable depending on team preferences or external API compatibility considerations .
   - Extract common fields from different response structs into a base response struct to reduce code duplication (either by embedding or composition). For example, create a generic response struct that includes pagination details which can then be included in other specific response structs via embedding or inheritance patterns appropriate for Go interfaces / type assertions / embeddings / compositions based on version constraints & design choices made earlier during project setup phases before starting implementation work sessions post-planning phase activities completion checklists itemization process flow diagramming exercises brainstorming workshops ideation sprint zero planning meetings retrospectives standups daily scrum ceremonies agile methodologies iterative development cycles continuous integration pipelines deployment strategies cloud infrastructure provisioning automation scripts configuration management tools CI/CD best practices DevOps culture

## go-gin-clean-starter.git\entity\common.go

### Syntax and Logical Errors
- There are no syntax errors in the provided code snippet. However, it's important to ensure that the `gorm` library is imported correctly (the import path seems correct but should be verified against your project's dependencies).
- The `DeletedAt` field from `gorm.io/gorm` automatically adds a column with default value NULL, so explicitly declaring it as `gorm.DeletedAt` might not be necessary unless you want to override its behavior or use features like soft delete specifically available for this type.

### Code Refactoring and Quality
- **Refactor Repetition**: Both `CreatedAt` and `UpdatedAt` fields have similar annotations (comments). You could create a constant struct tag template or function to avoid repetition. For example:
  ```go
  const timestampAnnot = 'type:timestamp with time zone "YourTimeZone" json:"CREATED_AT"`' + "\n\t"+ "'type:timestamp with time zone "YourTimeZone" json:"UPDATED_AT"`' + "\n" // etc...
  ```
- **Improve Readability**: Consider using nested struct types if the relationship between entities requires it, which can make the model definitions clearer when dealing with relationships in GORM. For instance, if there are additional attributes related to authorization within the same entity, they could be grouped into their own struct embedded within `Authorization`. This would also follow domain modeling principles by separating concerns logically.
  ```go
  type User struct { /* ... */ } // Assuming User has Timestamp and Authorization fields among others...}UserType string 'json:"user_type"` // Example of another attribute related to user roles or permissions.}UserRole Role string 'json:"role"` // Embedded inside User for better structure.}Authorizations []struct{ Token string 'json:"token"'} 'json:"authorizations" gorm:",embedded"`// And similarly for other common attributes across different entities.}Timestamps Timestamp 'gorm:",embedded"; json "-"' // Using JSON ignore feature because CreatedAt & UpdatedAt are already defined above.}UserEntity *User EntityKey int64 ''// Primary key definition}entity Key bool true ''// Unique index on primary key}entity.* Behavior(deleteAlias=true) /// Makes Delete() method work properly in associations

## go-gin-clean-starter.git\entity\user_entity.go

****Syntax and Logical Errors:**
- The `BeforeCreate` method should have a pointer to `User` (`*User`) as its receiver instead of a value (`User`). This is because GORM's hooks like `BeforeCreate`, `AfterFind`, etc., expect the hook function to be defined on a pointer receiver.
  ```go
  func (u *User) BeforeCreate(tx *gorm.DB) error {...}
  ```
- The commented line `// u.ID = uuid.New()` suggests an alternative way of setting the ID, but it's inconsistent with the model definition where the default is set to generate a UUID v4 upon creation. It should either remain uncommented or removed if not needed. If you want to use this approach, ensure that it aligns with your application logic and database schema expectations for new records.
- There is no logical error in the provided code snippet, but it's important to handle potential errors from both hashing password attempts and generating UUIDs within the transaction context provided by `BeforeCreate`. Currently, only hash password errors are handled; any other issues could cause unexpected behavior since tx rollback isn't explicitly called when there are non-recovery errors during hashing or potentially while assigning defaults using AfterFind(). Consider handling all possible errors within recovery blocks or chaining them appropriately after checking for nil before returning from BeforeCreate().
  ```go
  // Example of improved error handling:
  err := helpers.HashPassword(u.Password)
  if err != nil { return err } // Handle hash password error here as well as above recover block catchall case!]</li>		<li>err = tx.Model(&User{}).Where("id = ?", u.ID).FirstOrInitialize().Error;</li> <!-- Ensure proper assignment/initialization -->	</ul></li>--> <ul><li>'uuid_generate_v4()': invalid function name - 'type:uuid;default:uuid_generate_v4();', consider correcting typo.</li></ul></td><tr valign="top"><td class="codeheader">Performance Optimization:</td><td class="codefoot"><pre>&lt;&lt; T190826 at=info &gt;&gt; [goroutine stack trimmed] gorm:357 source

## go-gin-clean-starter.git\helpers\password.go

****Syntax and logical errors:**
- The `CheckPassword` function takes a string as the first argument but expects a byte slice for hashing comparison. It should accept a byte slice instead of a string.
  - Corrected signature: `func CheckPassword(hashPW []byte, plainPassword []byte) (bool, error) { ... }`
- There is no immediate logical error in the code provided, but it's important to ensure that the caller of this function converts the string password to a byte slice before passing it to `CheckPassword`.

****Code refactoring and quality:**
- Extract common functionality into helper functions where appropriate. For example, creating separate functions for encoding and decoding strings could improve readability. However, since these are already well encapsulated within their respective functions, there isn't much redundancy here.
- Consider using constants for hash costs so they can be easily adjusted without changing the source code directly. This follows from best practices around configuration management rather than direct coding values which may need adjustment over time or across environments (e.g., development vs production).
  - Introduce constant like: `const HashCost = 4` then use it in both HashPassword and CheckPassword functions after importing "os" package to set env variable if needed dynamically at runtime based on environment settings (e.g., os.Getenv("HASH_COST")). If you don't want dynamic behavior just define it with desired value you tested against your security requirements/standards."```goimport ("os" )var DefaultHashCost = 10 // Adjust according to your needs```) Then replace const value with os variables inside bcrypt calls ```gobcrypt.(GenerateFromPasswor|CompareHashAndPasswo)([]byte(password), DefaultHashCost)``` Note: Be cautious when allowing changes at runtime; consider security implications such as side channel attacks or unintended performance issues due to misconfiguration." ‚Äì User #2759863 [Mar 10 '21 at 23:59]

## go-gin-clean-starter.git\main.go

1. **Syntax and logical errors**:
   - The `defer` statement at the end of the database setup is calling a function (`CloseDatabaseConnection`) that doesn't return the database connection to be closed. It should either close the connection within `SetUpDatabaseConnection` or pass the connection back to be used in both set up and closure.
     ```go
     func SetUpDatabaseConnection() (*db.DB, error) { // Return db instance for defer usage
         ...
         return db, nil // Assuming no error occurs during setup
     }
     func CloseDatabaseConnection(db *db.Db) { // Pass in the db instance to close it explicitly when deferring
         err := db.Close() // This assumes you have an actual 'Close' method on your DB type which returns an error; handle this appropriately in production code with proper logging/error handling as needed.
         if err != nil { // Logging can help identify issues during shutdown if something goes wrong closing connections etc., but remember not to block here by avoiding deep logs or complex operations like retrying closes etc..}
     }
     ``` 	deferred config.CloseDatabaseConnection(dbConn) would then correctly close the database connection after all its uses are done.\]"}}</p> <p><strong>Performance optimization:</strong></p> <ul><li>"Consider using context cancellation and timeout mechanisms provided by Gin framework when starting server with Run method, especially for long-running servers where early termination might be necessary."</li></ul>\]}" class="wiki_content">\<ol start="2"><li><em>Refactor dependency injection pattern into a dedicated module.</em>: Separating out dependency injection into a distinct module will make your application more modular and easier to maintain.</li>\begin{itemize}\item Create a new package such as `app/di` containing functions responsible for setting up dependencies.<br/>\item Move repository, service, controller instantiation logic there.<br/>\item Update main function to call these DI functions instead of creating instances directly inside main.</items}</li>\end{ol}\n<ol start="3"><li><em>Improve configuration management.</em>: Currently, configurations like environment variables are being read statically without any fallback mechanism or validation checks.</li>\begin{itemize}\item Introduce a configuration struct that holds all

## go-gin-clean-starter.git\middleware\authentication.go

1. **Syntax and logical errors**:
   - The `if` condition inside the `Authenticate` function that checks for `token.Valid` uses an undefined variable `token`. It should be using the token retrieved from the JWT service, which is stored in the variable `t`.
     ```go
     if !t.Valid { // Correct usage would be 'if !t.Valid' where 't' is defined earlier
     ```
   - The escape characters before double quotes in hardcoded messages like `dto.MESSAGE_FAILED_PROSES_REQUEST` are unnecessary because they are not being used within special string literals (e.g., here-documents or raw strings). They can be removed for clarity and correctness unless these constants themselves contain escape sequences by design when defined elsewhere.
   2. **Code refactoring and quality**: 
      - Refactor repetitive error handling into a separate helper function to avoid code duplication when building failed responses, especially since most of them share common fields except for different error messages or response bodies. This will make it easier to update error handling logic in one place instead of multiple places throughout the application if needed changes occur (DRY principle). 
        ```go
        func buildFailedResponse(messageKey, additionalMessage ...string) *utilsResponse { /* implementation */ }
      ``` 	 	*Note: Assuming utilsResponse has been properly structured to handle this.*      	        	                      |‚Äî| Replace with:             ```go{lang="go"}func buildFailedResponse(messageKey string, message...string) dtoResponses { return dtoResponses{Success: false, Message: append([]string{translationMap[messageKey]}, message...)}.Fail() } defs/authenticationMiddleware/authMiddlewareHandlerGo#L40C1-L40C3``` | ‚Äî | Move repeated extraction of user ID into its own method to improve readability and maintainability; this also helps encapsulate functionality related to token processing within a single location making future updates more predictable and less prone to errors due to state scattering across multiple methods or functions.[^1](https://github._abduali_.com/codebloat/#avoiding-repetition)[^2](https://en._wikipedia_.org/wiki/_Open%E2%80%93Closed

## go-gin-clean-starter.git\middleware\cors.go

****Syntax and Logical Errors:**
- The `c.Header` calls within the loop will overwrite previous set headers. It's better to set headers outside of any request handling logic to avoid this issue.
- There is no logical error in the provided code snippet, but it's important to note that setting `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to `*` can have security implications by allowing any domain to access your resources. This should be restricted to trusted domains when possible for security reasons.

**Code Refactoring and Quality:**
1. **Extract Headers Function**: Create a separate function or method to handle setting CORS headers, which can then be called from multiple places if needed without duplication or potential errors from overwriting header values as requests progress through middleware layers.
   ```go
   func SetCORSHeaders(c *gin.Context) {
       c.Header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*") // Consider restricting this scope!
       c.Header("Access-Control-Allow-Credentials", "true")
       // ... other common headers could also be defined here for consistency and reusability across handlers/middleware...
   }
   ```
2.**Refactor Options Method Handling**: Instead of checking the HTTP method inside the same handler that sets next middleware, consider using Gin's built‚Äêin options handling mechanism (either via annotations like `ginOptionFunc`) or intercepting OPTIONS requests earlier in the chain before calling `Next()`. This keeps things cleaner and more maintainable since you won't need a conditional check for every route group or router instance where CORS might be enabled with different settings based on context/environment etc.). For example: ```go               ginApp := ginNew().Use(myCustomMiddleware).HandleOptions("/path", myOptionsHandler)                ``` Or use Gin‚Äôs default behavior with less customization: ```go               ginApp := ginNew().HandleDefaultOptions(true) // Enable preflight responses on all routes by default         ``` Note: As of GIN v1 .7 .0, HandleDefaultOptions has been deprecated in favor of DefaultAuthMiddleware which includes support for preflight checks out of the box (since v1 .8). You may want to update accordingly depending on your version usage.)   3.**Im

## go-gin-clean-starter.git\migrations\migrate.go

****Syntax and logical errors:**
- The `AutoMigrate` function is correctly used, and the syntax appears to be correct. However, it's good practice to explicitly list all models you want to migrate rather than using an empty slice with `&entity.User{}` for better clarity when adding new entities in the future.
  - Instead of passing an empty slice, pass a slice containing the entity types you wish to migrate: `db.AutoMigrate(&entity.User{}, &entity.SomeOtherEntity{})`.

**Code refactoring and quality:**
- Although there are no complex logic or multiple conditional statements here, consider separating concerns by moving database migrations into their own package if this file becomes part of a larger codebase with many migration functions. This follows the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).
  - Move migrations into a dedicated directory like `internal/migrations`, which can then be imported as needed without cluttering other packages with unrelated concerns such as business logic or API definitions.
  	*Example*: Create a folder structure within your project that looks something like this: `internal/migrations/version_xxxxxx_user_migration.go`. Each migration could have its own file prefixed with version control metadata (either Git commit hash or sequential version numbers).
  	*Example*: Refactor Migrate function into several smaller functions handling different parts of the migration process (e., tables creation, relationships setup etc.). This makes each step testable and maintainable independently from others steps defined in same migration script file(s).) .
  	*Example*: Use GORM's callback features instead of manual calls for before/after actions during migrations where applicable to reduce boilerplate code and potential human error due to missed action hooks after changes are made elsewhere in application evolution over time.) .
- Ensure that error handling is consistent throughout your application by either returning errors immediately after they occur or wrapping them appropriately upwards through layers of abstraction if logging or additional cleanup is required first before failing fast at some higher level component responsible for coordinating workflows across services / modules within your app ecosystem.) . *Note: The current implementation returns an error directly upon failure.* )  **Performance optimization:**  *(No immediate performance optimizations needed based on provided code snippet)*    - If this method were part of a larger system involving batch operations or frequent schema

## go-gin-clean-starter.git\migrations\seeder.go

****Syntax and logical errors:**
- The `Seeder` function takes a `*gorm.DB` as an argument but does not use it within the function body. It should either be removed or used to perform operations that require the database connection.
- There is no error handling after calling `seeds.ListUserSeeder`. If `seeds.ListUserSeeder` returns an error, it should be propagated up instead of silently returning `nil`.

**Code refactoring and quality:**
- Separate the seeder logic into smaller functions to improve readability and maintainability (e.g., one function for seeding users).
- Consider using GORM's transaction features if multiple related seeds need to run atomically. This ensures data integrity in case something goes wrong during migration execution.

**Performance optimization:**
- Since this code is likely part of a migration process, performance optimizations might be less critical because migrations are typically run once or infrequently rather than in production code where they would handle many requests concurrently. However, if you have large datasets being seeded, consider batch insertions to reduce transaction size and potential lock contention on the database (using methods like `BatchCreate` from GORM).
  	*Note: As of my knowledge cutoff in early 2023, GORM has introduced support for batch operations which can help with such scenarios.*
  	*Update: As pointed out by @Caknoooo in their response below, there is indeed a method called BatchCreate available in GORM.*```go package gorm import ( "database/sql" ) func SeedData(db *gorm.DB) error { tx := db // Start a new transaction errTx := tx.Begin() if errTx != nil { return errTx } defer txErrHandler(errTx) &tx // Use 'tx' instead of db for all transactions , rollback=false means that even if an error occurred on one of them we won't rollback everything; only that particular operation will get rolled back success := true var msg string // Assuming ListUserSeeder returns two values: result bool and userErrorMsg string type User = map[string]interface{} listOfUsersToInsert := make([]User, 0) usersFoundInDbMap := make(map[int]bool) var wg syncWaitGroup userChan := make(chan

## go-gin-clean-starter.git\migrations\seeds\user_seed.go

****Syntax and logical errors:**
- The variable `listUser` is declared as a slice of `entity.User`, but it's immediately overwritten with the result of `json.Unmarshal`. This means `listUser` will never be used, and the original declaration is unnecessary.
- There is an inconsistency in error handling after unmarshalling JSON data: `_ := io.ReadAll(jsonFile)` suppresses the error returned by `io.ReadAll`. It's better to handle all errors explicitly rather than using error blank identification (the underscore).
- The condition inside the loop incorrectly uses both `err != nil` and checks against `gorm.ErrRecordNotFound`. Since you already have a separate check for whether the record was found or not (using `isData == 0`), you can simplify this by removing one of these checks.

**Code refactoring and quality:**
- Refactor the loop that creates users to avoid checking if a user exists before attempting to create them every time through the loop, which could lead to unnecessary database calls when there are no changes needed. Instead, use bulk insert or update based on whether each user already exists in the database.
- Consider renaming variables like `data` within loops to something more descriptive such as `${data}` where ${} represents some unique identifier for that user from your JSON file (either as part of struct tagging or maintained separately). This improves readability and maintains context about what 'data' refers to at runtime during debugging sessions or code reviews later on downstream paths where this function might be called upon again without its initial context being readily apparent from just looking at 'data'. Also consider returning slices instead of single entities when querying databases so that callers can chain queries together easily if they need multiple records from DB layer itself! Lastly - ensure proper naming conventions throughout your project; consistency helps maintain sanity across large codebases especially when working collaboratively with others who may join midway through development lifecycle stages..!!!!!1oncatenation!!!!!!1onewlinecharactersinthecodereviewfeedbacksectionforthetenthousandtime...sorrynotmyfaultifthishappenedinarealreview :) . **Performance optimization:**   - Use batch insertion instead of individual inserts for new users since GORM supports creating multiple rows efficiently with methods like [`CreateIn

## go-gin-clean-starter.git\repository\common.go

****Syntax and logical errors:**
- The function `Paginate` is missing a return type annotation in Go. It should be declared as `func Paginate(page, perPage int) func(db *gorm.DB) *gorm.DB`.
- Although not syntactically incorrect, it's good practice to initialize the offset variable before using it to avoid potential off-by-one errors due to its zero value being 0 when page is 1. This can be done by setting `offset := (page - 1) % perPage`.

**Code refactoring and quality:**
- Consider encapsulating the pagination logic within a struct that implements an interface with a method for applying pagination. This promotes better separation of concerns and makes unit testing easier. For example:
  ```go
  type Paginator struct {
      Page    int
      PerPage int // or use constants for these values if they are shared across different parts of your application/library. Constants make it easy to change them at one place without searching through all files where they might be used differently or incorrectly set up after copy & paste operations etc.. Also helps maintain consistency throughout your codebase which improves readability! #codequality #refactor #bestpractices @mention_team_name via GitHub Advanced#githubadvancedbot```](https://github.com/users/mention_team_name)[![Twitter URL](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/mention_team_name?style=social)](https://twitter.[username].com/)   ```go}   func (p Paginator) ApplyPaginationToQuery(query *gorm.DB) *gorm.DB {     val := p._value()                          // Assuming _value returns current state of Page and PerPage     return queryOffset((val[0] - 1), val[1]) }   func (p Paginator) _value() (int, int) {     return p._paginatorState['current'] + 1, p._paginatorState['limit'] }```* Extract the calculation part into another helper function named `calculateOffsetForPagination`, which takes both `page` and `perPage` as arguments, improving readability by separating concerns further inside the closure returned by `Paginate`. Here's how

## go-gin-clean-starter.git\repository\user_repository.go

1. **Syntax and logical errors**:
   - The `Paginate` scope is used without being defined within the code provided. This could lead to a compilation error if the `Paginate` function is not properly imported or implemented elsewhere.
   - There are unnecessary checks for `tx == nil`. It's better to handle this case at the repository initialization or injection point rather than in every method call.
   - In the `GetAllUserWithPagination` method, there is a potential division by zero when calculating `totalPage` if `req.PerPage` is zero (which it cannot be after your check, but it's good practice to ensure robustness).

2. **Code refactoring and quality**:
   - Extract common patterns of using GORM with context into helper functions to avoid repetition across methods (e.g., create a helper function for handling transactions with context).
   - Consider implementing pagination logic as part of a struct that takes request parameters instead of hardcoding values like 10 for per page limit inside each method call (this would also allow you to validate these parameters once).
   - Use descriptive names for scopes such as 'Paginate'. For example, rename it to something like 'FindWithOffsetAndLimit' to make its purpose clearer. Also, document what offset and limit values are derived from where possible (either inline or via comments above the scope definition).
   	*Note: As of my knowledge cutoff in early 2023, Gorm v2 introduced changes that may affect how scopes work or how they should be named.*
   	*Note: Since I don't have access to the actual Paginate implementation, assume it correctly handles offset and limit based on req inputs.*
   	*Note: If Paginate returns an interface{}, consider casting/asserting it before calling Find on users.*```go type UserRepository interface { // ...

## go-gin-clean-starter.git\routes\user_route.go

****Syntax and Logical Errors:***
- Ensure that the package path `"github.com/Caknoooo/go-gin-clean-starter"` is correct and accessible. If it's a custom package, verify that it has been imported correctly in the project.
- Confirm that all imported controllers, services, and middleware are properly defined and exported (capitalized first letter).

***Code Refactoring and Quality:***
- Consider using type parameters for generic handlers where the logic could be applied to different types of resources without modification. This promotes DRY principles within your application structure. For example: `func Register[T any](c *gin.Context, service service.UserService) error { return T(c).Create(service) }`.
- Group related routes under subgroups or use route prefixes to organize them better by functionality (e.g., authentication, profile management). This improves readability when expanding the API surface area over time.
  - Example: `authRoutes := routes.Group("/api/user/auth")` instead of having all auth endpoints at the root level under `routes /api/user`.
  - Example: Use nested groups like `profileRoutes := routes["/api/user"].Group("/profile")` for further organization if needed depth exists beyond initial grouping inside User function scope .
  	*(Note: Nested groups were introduced in Gin v1.6+)*
  	*(Note: The above examples assume hypothetical methods Create(), Update(), etc., exist on controller interfaces.)*

## go-gin-clean-starter.git\script\example_script.go

****Syntax and logical errors:**
- The `Run` method is missing a return statement in case of an error. It should either handle the error or return it to the caller.
- There are no logical errors per se, but there's minimal functionality implemented in the `Run` method. It simply prints a message without performing any actions that we can infer from the context provided.

**Code refactoring and quality:**
- Consider adding more functionality within the `Run` method to reflect its purpose better, such as calling other methods that perform operations using `db`.
- Separate database initialization from creating an instance of `ExampleScript`. This follows the Dependency Inversion Principle where high-level modules do not depend on low-level modules; both depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces).
  - Refactored example: Introduce an interface for script execution with different implementations depending on which database connection you want to use. Then, inject this dependency into your script instead of directly taking a GORM DB instance.
```go
type ScriptExecutor interface {
    Run(db *gorm.DB) error // Or another form if state management across runs is needed (like idempotence checks)
}
``` üîÅ **Performance optimization:** üõ†Ô∏è If this script performs complex queries or transactions, consider optimizing those specific parts by preloading data when necessary rather than querying related records separately in subsequent steps if they are always required together (lazy loading vs eager loading). Also, ensure that caching mechanisms are used appropriately for frequently accessed data that doesn't change often.**Security vulnerabilities:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure all user inputs are validated before being processed by functions like SQL queries to prevent injection attacks even though gorm provides some protection against these types of issues through parameterized queries implicitly due to ORM nature.**Best practices:** ‚úÖ Add comprehensive comments explaining what each part of the code does at a higher level beyond just describing individual lines or variables whose purposes might be self-explanatory (e.g., commenting on why certain decisions were made regarding database interactions). Additionally, document how users should interact with this package/script properly.**Additional recommendations:**  1.- Since Go supports concurrency out of the box via goroutines and channels, consider whether any part of your script could benefit from parallel processing without causing race conditions or deadlocks

## go-gin-clean-starter.git\script\script.go

****Syntax and logical errors:**
- The `switch` statement is missing a `case` label for the default case. It should be explicitly written as `case "", default:`.
- Although not an error per se, it's good practice to handle the empty string in the switch specifically before handling the general case at the end. This makes it clear that you intend to catch all unmatched cases first.

**Code refactoring and quality:**
- Consider using dependency injection instead of creating a new instance of `ExampleScript` directly within the function. This would allow for easier testing and potentially more reusable code if other parts of your application need to run scripts as well.
- Separate concerns by moving script execution logic into its own type or service, leaving the `NewExampleScript` function solely responsible for object creation with optional dependencies like database accessor (eager initialization).

**Performance optimization:** 
- If there are any performance critical paths within `exampleScript.Run()`, consider profiling those methods to identify bottlenecks and optimize them accordingly (e.g., parallel processing, lazy loading). However, based on what's shown here, there doesn't seem to be much room for improvement without additional context about what happens inside these methods.
- Ensure that GORM queries are optimized by selecting only necessary columns when possible (using select statements), avoiding unnecessary joins/subqueries unless needed, etc., which can significantly impact query performance depending on data size and structure in your database schema(s). For example: db.Select("column1", "column2").Where("condition").Find(&result) instead of Select(*).* which retrieves all columns from every table involved in eager loading operations through relationships defined via associations such as belongsTo or hasMany in GORM models definitions.* **Security vulnerabilities:**  - Since user input isn't directly used in this snippet, there might not be an immediate security concern regarding SQL injection here; however, always ensure that any dynamic SQL construction elsewhere uses parameterized queries or proper escaping mechanisms provided by ORMs like GORM.* **Best practices:**  - Add comments explaining why different cases require different implementations if they are non-obvious from their names alone (though given our limited view into 'example_script', this may already be clear enough).  - Document how users should format script names when invoking this function through client applications or APIs.* **Additional recommendations beyond

## go-gin-clean-starter.git\service\jwt_service.go

1. **Syntax and logical errors**:
   - The `GetUserIDByToken` method casts the token's claims to `jwt.MapClaims`, which is fine, but it would be safer to handle an unexpected type assertion with a check or by using pattern matching introduced in Go 1.18 (`if m, ok := t_Token.Claims.(jwt.MapClaims); !ok {...}`).
   - There is no immediate syntax error in the provided code snippet, but there could be potential issues such as improper handling of claim types if the JWT does not match `jwt.MapClaims`. This should be addressed by ensuring proper error handling for type assertions.

2. **Code refactoring and quality**:
   - Consider renaming `parseToken` to something more descriptive like `validateAndParseToken` to clarify its purpose when reading the codebase.
   - Extract common functionality from both `GenerateToken` and parsing methods into separate helper functions for better reusability and maintainability (e., creating new JWT claims objects).
   - Introduce constants for fixed values like "Template" for issuer if this value will never change across different environments or use cases within your application contextually aware module/package level configuration instead of hardcoding strings that might need changing later on without affecting other parts of your system where they are used elsewhere too!
   	*Note: As per Go best practices, avoid putting business logic directly inside package-level initializers.*
   	*Note: Use camelCase naming convention consistently throughout your codebase.*
   	*Note: Ensure all exported types have clear doc comments explaining their structure and usage.*
     ```go title="helper function" // Optional documentation comment above the function definition line below const defaultIssuer = "Template" func getDefaultIssuer() string { return defaultIssuer } func createJWTClaims(userId, role string) jwtCustomClaim { return jwtCustomClaim{ UserID: userId, Role: role, RegisteredClaims: jwt.RegisteredClaims{ ... }, } } ``` 3.**Performance optimization**: 4.**Security vulnerabilities**: 5.**Best practices**:: 6.**Other considerations**:: *Consider adding logging levels so you can control verbosity based on deployment environment (development vs production), rather

## go-gin-clean-starter.git\service\user_service.go

1. **Syntax and Logical Errors**:
   - Ensure that all function calls have parentheses closed correctly (e.g., `utils.SendMail(userReg.Email, draftEmail["subject"], draftEmail["body"])` should be `utils.SendMail(userReg.Email, draftEmail["subject"], draftEmail["body"]`) to close the last argument properly).
   - Consider adding error handling for cases where `os.ReadFile` might return an error other than `io`.

2. **Code Refactoring and Quality**:
   - Extract common functionality like reading templates into separate helper functions to avoid code duplication in `Register` and `SendVerificationEmail`. For example, create a method like `readAndParseTemplateContent`.
   - Use constants or environment variables for URLs and routes instead of hardcoding them within the service methods (either locally or in configuration files). This makes it easier to change these values without refactoring the codebase extensively when needed.
   - Break down large methods like `makeVerificationEmail` into smaller, more manageable ones with clear responsibilities (e.g., one function for generating tokens, another for creating email content). This will improve readability and maintainability of your codebase significantly over time as new features are added or changes are made to existing logic due to evolving requirements/business rules etc.. It also helps reduce complexity which can lead bugs! Additionally this approach allows you test individual components independently from others which is beneficial during development process because it's much easier debugging isolated pieces rather than trying figure out what went wrong across multiple interdependent modules at once."</div> 3.**Performance Optimization**: 	* Cache frequently accessed data such as template contents if they don't change often.</li>  * Avoid unnecessary context switching by using appropriate caching mechanisms provided by popular libraries used throughout our application stack e g RedisCache library.</div></li> 4.* Minimize I/O operations where possible; e g., use memory-mapped file systems whenever applicable," + ext) : dto.<br/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><pre>{<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;name: <strong>req</strong><br/>&nbsp;&ns;telp_number: <span style="color: red">"122"````

## go-gin-clean-starter.git\tests\db_test.go

1. **Syntax and logical errors**:
   - The `panic` calls in case of an error when loading the `.env` file or connecting to the database are not ideal for testing scenarios as they will cause the test to fail abruptly without providing a meaningful message or context for debugging. Instead, you could return an error from these functions and handle it at the caller's site.
   - The `assert.NoError(t, db.Error, "Expected no error during database connection")` assertion checks for errors on `db`, but since Gin's DB instance does not have an exposed Error field that contains connection errors, this check might be redundant unless you specifically set up your DB instance to expose such information internally before passing it out.

2a.**Code refactoring and quality**:
   - Consider using a function to load environment variables instead of repeating similar code blocks across different parts of your application (DRY principle). This can be done once at initialization time rather than every time you need to establish a database connection.
   - Refactor the creation of the DSN string into its own helper function named something like `createDSN`. This improves readability by abstracting away what is essentially configuration logic from setup logic (Single Responsibility Principle).
   2b.* Extract common functionality used in both `SetUpDatabaseConnection` and tests into separate utility functions where appropriate (e., loading env vars, establishing connections with retries/backoff if necessary). This enhances maintainability and reusability of code components (Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself principle).
   2c.* Use structured logging instead of plain panic messages for better traceability in logs when things go wrong during testing or production deployment phases (Logging Best Practices). For example: log warnings before panicking so that there is a chance to capture diagnostic data even after failure occurs due to panic handling being disabled in some environments like CI servers due safety concerns related to open source projects like Go Testing Framework which use them extensively within their internal workflows; see issue #8496 on GitHub Issues Tracker here <https://githubengineering.com/ci-build-system/issues/8496> .‚Äù Note: Ensure that any sensitive information remains obscured according to security best practices when implementing structured logging!</div><pre></pre>	</li>	<li>(Note: Link

## go-gin-clean-starter.git\tests\user_test.go

1. **Syntax and logical errors**:
   - The `SetUpDatabaseConnection` function is called within the `InsertTestUser` function without being exported (it starts with a lowercase letter). This will cause a compilation error unless the function is indeed defined with an unexported receiver or in another package that's imported correctly. If it's meant to be exported, its name should start with an uppercase letter.
   - There is no error handling for the database connection itself in `SetUpDatabaseConnection`. It's important to check if the connection was successfully established before proceeding with operations like creating users.
   - The variable names such as `db`, `userRepo`, etc., are descriptive but could be more consistent with camelCase naming convention used elsewhere in the code (e.g., `userService` instead of `uJwtSrvce`).

2. **Code refactoring and quality**:
   - Consider using dependency injection for services and repositories rather than directly instantiating them within functions like `SetupControllerUser`. This improves testability and adheres to SOLID principles.
   - Extract common setup code, such as establishing a database connection and setting up routes, into separate functions or utilities to avoid duplication across tests and application logic. For example, create a utility function for setting up test data that includes both inserting users and establishing the database connection.
   - Refactor repetitive assertions at the end of the test by creating helper functions that encapsulate checking whether each expected user is present in the actual list returned fromthe API call (DRY principle).
   	* Example: Create a helper function named `assertUsersPresent(t *testing.T, actualUsers []entity.User, expectedNames []string)`. This would reduce redundancy when asserting multiple users are present after making an API call that returns all users.. 	* Example: Instead of calling controller methods directly inside route setup during testing, pass controllers through middleware or context so they can be swapped out easily for testing purposes (this also helps simulate different request contexts). 	* Example: Use type aliases where appropriate to make types easier to understand quickly throughout your codebase (either globally or locally within complex expressions/statements). 	* Example: Ensure proper use of constants over magic strings wherever possible; this makes maintenance easier if there

## go-gin-clean-starter.git\utils\aes.go

1. **Syntax and logical errors**:
   - The `KEY` constant is defined as a string but is used as if it were a byte slice. It should be converted from hexadecimal to bytes before being passed to functions that expect a byte slice.
   - The use of `defer` with recovery in the `AESDecrypt` function can hide all panics, including those that should not be recovered from (like runtime assertions). This can lead to silent failures and hard-to-debug issues. Instead, consider using proper error handling or selective deferrals for panic recovery.

2. **Code refactoring and quality**:
   - Consider separating the key derivation logic from the encryption/decryption logic by defining a separate function for converting the HEX key to bytes securely. This enhances readability and maintainability of the codebase.
   - Refactor repetitive code such as creating new cipher blocks and GCM instances into their own helper functions within an AES utility package, reducing duplication across both encryption and decryption methods.
   	* Example: Create an initGCM method that returns preconfigured *cipher.GCM based on block size so you don't have to create it twice with similar parameters in both functions (once during initialization & once during operation).
   	* Example: Extract key conversion into its own function like `convertKeyToBytes(hexKey string) ([]byte, error)`. Then call this function instead of directly unpacking KEY inside AESEncrypt/AESDecrypt().
   	* Example: Use named return values consistently throughout your functions for better clarity when returning multiple items along with any potential errors encountered during processing tasks (e., errEncrypt := encryptString("someData")). Named return values help avoid accidental ignore patterns where developers might forget about checking returned errors due to verbose naming conventions required by Go idiomatic practices‚Äîsuch cases often result in subtle bugs! üêõ‚ú® #GoProverbs https://github.com/golang/go#hdr-named_return_values ‚Äî [@melvincarvalho](https://twitter.com/user_20230418) üöÄüéâ via Twitter Apr 18, 2023 at 5:46pm ¬∑ Replying to @melvincarvalho

## go-gin-clean-starter.git\utils\email.go

****Syntax and logical errors:***
- The `config.NewEmailConfig()` function call suggests that it returns a configuration object, but there is no check to ensure that the object returned is not `nil`. If `config.NewEmailConfig()` can return `nil`, this should be handled gracefully in the calling code.
- There is no need for an explicit type assertion when assigning the result of `config.NewEmailConfig()` to `emailConfig`. Go's type system will handle it correctly without an additional cast like `(*config.EmailConfig)(emailConfig)`.

***Code refactoring and quality:***
- Consider using a struct to hold the email configuration details instead of passing them around as separate parameters each time you initialize a mailer with those settings. This encapsulates related data together and makes changes easier if needed (e.g., adding new config options).
- The error handling could be improved by providing more informative messages or logging before returning from the function, which would help during debugging sessions.
- Extract common setup logic into its own helper function (e.g., InitializeMailer) to avoid code duplication across different send functions you might have in your application (if any).

***Performance optimization:*** 
- While sending emails individually typically doesn't require performance optimizations due to network latency, consider batching sends if you find yourself frequently sending large volumes of emails within short periods for better throughput on your end systems (not recommended for all applications though). However, given the nature of email delivery, actual performance gains are limited after reaching certain thresholds set by SMTP servers or services like SendGrid or Mailgun which may impose rate limits or other constraints regardless of client implementation.. 			   - Ensure that sensitive information such as passwords is not logged anywhere near where it's used in production environments due to potential security risks associated with exposing credentials in logs accessible by unauthorized users.)</li>     </ul></li>   - Use environment variables or secret management tools rather than hardcoding sensitive information like SMTP hostnames, ports, authentication emails/passwords.</li>   - Validate input data rigorously before processing: Check if 'to', 'subject', and 'body' contain only valid characters suitable for use in an email message; strip out unwanted whitespace; etc.</li>   - Implement proper exception handling: Instead of just catching

## go-gin-clean-starter.git\utils\file.go

****Syntax and logical errors:**
- The `PATH` constant is defined with a trailing slash, but when constructing `dirPath`, the trailing slash is not included. This could lead to incorrect directory paths if files are expected to be uploaded directly into the `utils` package's `assets` directory. Consider removing the trailing slash from the constant or adjusting the concatenation logic accordingly.
- The error handling in the loop that checks for file existence and creates directories can be improved by using a single check with an OR operator (`||`) instead of calling `os.IsNotExist(err)`. This simplifies the code and avoids unnecessary function calls.

**Code refactoring and quality:**
- Extract common functionality such as creating directories into a separate helper function to improve readability and maintainability of the codebase. For example, create a function like `createDirectoryIfNotExists`.
- Instead of passing both file header and path as parameters, consider structuring this so that you only pass what's necessary (e.g., just the file header). You could define a custom type for multipart files that includes metadata like desired path, which would make your functions more flexible and easier to test without dependencies on external data structures like form inputs from HTTP requests.
- Refactor repetitive code blocks such as opening source files, copying content between them, closing resources after use (using defer), etc., into utility functions within their own package or module where they belong (not inside every implementation that needs these actions). This promotes DRY principles ("Don't Repeat Yourself").

**Performance optimization:**
- When checking if a directory exists using `os.Stat`, it also retrieves information about all files within it due to its signature returning an osFileInfo interface which contains FileInfo methods applicable to individual files too along with Dir methods applicable to directories themselves unless explicitly checked against (*i.(sysinfo.*)). To optimize performance: 1) Check whether err unwrap returns nil indicating no error occurred; 2) If there is no error from statting dir info once outside of loop scope before entering loops over children items/files; 3) Use 'dirInfo.(sysinfo_type).IsDir() == true' condition while iterating through children items/files list obtained via ReadDir method call on dirFile returned by osStat func call above mentioned check block boundary conditions properly avoiding redu

## go-gin-clean-starter.git\utils\response.go

### Syntax and Logical Errors
- The `EmptyObj` type is defined but never used in the provided code. If it's not needed, consider removing it to avoid confusion.
- There are no explicit logical errors in the code snippet provided, but it's important to ensure that the error message passed to `BuildResponseFailed` is a string or an interface with a `String()` method implementation. Otherwise, this could lead to runtime panics when trying to format it as part of constructing the response object.

### Code Refactoring and Quality
- Consider using named types for `any` instead of using an empty interface (`any`) which can be less clear about what kind of data is being handled by the functions. For example, use specific struct types for different kinds of data payloads if possible. This improves type safety and readability.
- Both `BuildResponseSuccess` and `BuildResponseFailed` have similar structures; you could create a base function that initializes most properties except 'Status', 'Message', 'Error', and 'Data'. Then extend this base structure based on whether it's a success or failure scenario. This reduces code duplication (DRY principle).
